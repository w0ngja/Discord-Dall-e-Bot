# Discord-Dall-e-Bot

A fun discord bot that uses the DALL.E 2 engine to create original, unique images and art from a users text description.

For help using the discord bot type the $help command in the Discord channel:

To generate an image use the $dalle command followed by an image suggestion:

Thanks and have fun!

# Hosting the Bot
A range of hosting options exist for the bot but for its ease of use, flexibility and relatively low price, I elected to host this Discord bot on a Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance./
As the image generation process isnt computationally difficult I selected a t2.micro instance and may elect to move to a t2.nano instance in the future

v1.0.1: Added exception clauses for dalle image generation rules\
v1.0: Initial Release
